                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    My name is Eliza, and I am a game developer with a passion for open-world exploration games. <br>
                    Ever since I was a child, I've had a passion for creating games. <br>
                    I immediately started looking for a school, which led me to Mediacollege Amsterdam.<br> 
                    From the moment I joined this school, I became very eager to learn. always wanted to learn more. <br>
                    Recently, I have developed an interest in biology, along with the opportunities of combining the two. 
                    
                    <br><br>My learning journey is far from over to say the least.

                    <div class="Hobby">
                        <h4>Gaming</h4>
                        <p>One of my favorite pass times is gaming. I play multiple games, such as Minecraft, Phasmophobia, Genshin Impact, Stardew Valley, and many more.
                            When playing games, I usually play with friends. It's probably when I am most social.

                    <div class="Hobby">
                        <h4>Cosplaying</h4>
                        <p>I have yet to cosplay, but I am currently working on my first ever costume. Cosplaying allows me to express my creativity through dressing up as
                            fictional characters, and creating their outfits. Along with that, I enjoy meeting fellow cosplayers and seeing other cosplays. 
                        </p>

                        <p>There are multiple instruments that I play! The instruments I play are guitar, ukulele, and I have basic knowledge of piano chords. Along with that
                            I enjoy singing. Specifically musical songs.

                        <h4>Drawing</h4>
                        <p>This is a hobby I don't do quite as often as I used to, but I do enjoy drawing and doodling silly things here and there. 
                            Drawing is a way I like to express myself, and I like doing either traditional art, or pixel art.
